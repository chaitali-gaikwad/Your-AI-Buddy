# Your AI Buddy
 This is my 3rd year project for Diploma in Computer Engineering. This is an AI based healing application.
Following are the salient features:

2.	**_Meditation_** feature helps user meditate by choosing the music depending on their mood.
3.	Using **_My Goals_** feature user can create, edit, delete goals anytime. On completing goals application will praise user, encouraging him to achieve more goals.
